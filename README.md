## Net
### For hosting to internet you need:
- Public(also known as "White ip") ip address: For example `10.0.0.0/24`, `10.172.0.0/24`(and other local ips) is not public ip; You can check this ip in your router, just find `Default gateway` line
- If your ip is public - just open ports on your router
## Now if you did everything correctly and checked the web server should be accessible at your public IP address
### If not:
- You haven't powered your board
- Your ip is gray(not pubic)
- If 100% ip is public - the ports were not opened correctly
- Check the logs in the serial monitor - whether the board was connected to wifi
## For hiding your origin ip you can use cloudflare and your domain, I won’t write about it here, go on yourself if you need to, I don’t even think this will be useful to anyone, I like writing readme
